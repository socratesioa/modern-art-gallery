## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- **Bonus**: Use [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) to create an interactive location map with custom location pin

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that in some cases, mobile first approach might not be the best way. I coded the entire challenge using a mobile first approach except for the hero section.

### Continued development

I really enjoyed this challenge. The design is beautiful and I find that I really enjoy coding this kinds of designs. I learned about the mix-blend-modes in this one and practiced CSS positioning. I need to be more aware of keeping my code clean especially for larger projects.
